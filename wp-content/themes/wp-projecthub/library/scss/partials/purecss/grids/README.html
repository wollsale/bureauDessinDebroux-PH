<p>Pure Grids ship with build-in 5ths- and 24ths-based units styles. The unit style
rules are generated via Pure&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/ericf/rework-pure-grids"><code>rework-pure-grids</code></a>
<a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/rework">Rework</a> plugin.</p>

<p>The tooling used by Pure to generate its built-in Grids can also be used to
create custom Grids that use any nth-unit base.</p>
